description: Write an Architecture Decision Record in this repo's numbering and format. Use when a design decision should be recorded, a new assumption is made where the model is silent, or a change contradicts an existing ADR.

# How to write an ADR

## Numbering and location

`docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, four digits, sequential. Check the highest
number with `ls docs/adr/`; never reuse one. Add a row to `docs/adr/index.md`
(`| [NNNN](./file.md) | title | Status (date) |`). The ADR index is the only place
the list lives.

## Format

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: title (a short noun phrase)

## Status

Accepted (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Context

The forces that make this decision necessary, with the alternatives seriously
weighed (a reader later must see the simpler option was considered).

## Decision

What was decided, in the present tense, numbered when there are several parts.

## Consequences

What becomes easier, what becomes harder, what to watch.
```

## Rules

- **Bodies are immutable.** A changed decision is a NEW ADR whose Status says it
  supersedes the old one; the old one's Status becomes `Superseded by ADR NNNN`.
  The one exception: ADR 0002 keeps a dated `## Amendment` section per build step,
  because its assumptions (A1, A2, ...) are numbered and referenced from code
  comments, tests and the report to the orchestrator. Append `A<n+1>`; never renumber.
- **Assumptions.** Where `model/model.yaml` (or the Model Gap Register) is silent,
  choose the least-surprising reading, record it as the next `A<n>` in ADR 0002 and
  report it as a model gap. Never edit the model or the docs repo from here.
- **The CloudEvents catalogue** (ADR 0004) is read by a fitness test:
  `type: ... stream: ...` lines must match `apis/asyncapi.yaml`; see
  `how-to-add-an-integration-event`.
- Cross-context decisions (an event shape, a call between contexts) are decided by
  the orchestrator in contracts-delta, not by one repo: cite it, do not contradict it.
- Name real files and Err variables; no company or brand names anywhere.

## After writing

`python3 scripts/harness/repo_lint.py`, `python3 scripts/harness/guide_lint.py`
(every path an ADR or guide cites must exist) and `make check`.
